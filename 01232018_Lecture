Sequence alignments.

Edit graph for a pair of sequences.
On an edit graph, depth follows a diagonal through each pair of bases (see lecture for illustration).
Paths are alignments of subsequences. Diagonals pull a base from each sequence. Horizontals and verticals put a gap character in one sequence.
