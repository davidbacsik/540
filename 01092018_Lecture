Order is basic unit of run time.
Coefficient matters enourmously, too though.

In an undirected graph, an edge connects two points and is non-directional.
In a directed graph, each node has a number of inputs (in-degree) and outputs (out-degree).
A path of length K follows a sequence of edges between several points (vertexes).

Path is a valid walk through several vertices.
Cycle is a path through vertices back to originating vertex.

A directed acyclic graph is a directed graph with no cycles.
Parent/child relationship: edge connects the two vertices.
Ancestor/Descendant: path connects the two vertices.

In a DAG, the length of a path cannot exceed V-1, because otherwise you get a cycle.

Depth = lenght of the longest path ending at V.
Every descendent (w) of a node (v) has higer depth than v.
